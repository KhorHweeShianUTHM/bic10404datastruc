# Employee Management System #

## Overview
This program implements an Employee Management System using C. It allows users to add, update, delete, display, and search for employees. The employee data is stored in memory and can be saved to and loaded from a file (`employees.dat`).

## Features
- Add Employee: Enter details such as ID, Name, NRIC, Department, and Salary for a new employee.
- Update Employee: Modify details (Name, NRIC, Department, Salary) of an existing employee based on ID.
- Delete Employee: Remove an employee from the system based on ID.
- Display Employees: View all employees sorted by ID in tabular format.
- Search Employee: Find and display details of an employee by entering their ID.
- Save and Load: Persist employee data to `employees.dat` file and reload it when the program starts.

## Compilation Instructions
To compile the program, ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system.

## Running the Program
After compilation, execute the program by entering F10 (if you are using devC++)

Follow the on-screen menu to interact with the Employee Management System.

## File Description (`employees.dat`)
The program uses `employees.dat` to save employee data between sessions:
- File Format: Binary file storing instances of `struct Employee`.
- Usage: Automatically created and read by the program to persist employee data.

Note: Ensure the program has write permissions for `employees.dat` to save data successfully.

## Important Notes
- Input Validation: Various functions validate user inputs (ID, Name, NRIC, Salary) to ensure data integrity.
- Memory Management: Memory allocated for employees is freed appropriately to prevent memory leaks.
- Error Handling: Basic error handling is implemented for file operations and input validation failures.
